The SGI Free Software License B version 2.0 is a free software license. It is essentially identical to the X11 License, with an optional alternative way of providing license notices.
Previous versions of the SGI Free Software License B were not free software licenses, despite their name. However, they all included clauses that allow you to upgrade to new versions of the license, if you choose to do so. As a result, if a piece of software was released under any version of the SGI Free License B, you can use it under the terms of this free version.
