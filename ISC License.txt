This license is sometimes also known as the OpenBSD License. It is a free software license, and compatible with the GNU GPL.
This license had an unfortunate wording choice: it provided recipients with “Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software…” This was the same language from the license of Pine that the University of Washington later claimed prohibited people from distributing modified versions of the software.
ISC has told us they do not share the University of Washington's interpretation, and we have every reason to believe them. ISC also updated the license to read “Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software…” While the inclusion of “and/or” doesn't completely solve the issue, there's no reason to avoid software released under this license. However, to help make sure this language cannot cause any trouble in the future, we encourage developers to choose a different license for their own works. The FreeBSD License is similarly permissive and brief. However, if you want a lax, weak license, we recommend using the Apache 2.0 license.
