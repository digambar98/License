This is the latest version of the GNU GPL: a free software license, and a copyleft license.
 We recommend it for most software packages.
Please note that GPLv3 is not compatible with GPLv2 by itself. 
However, most software released under GPLv2 allows you to use the terms of later versions of the GPL as well.
 When this is the case, you can use the code under GPLv3 to make the desired combination.
