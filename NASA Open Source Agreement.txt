The NASA Open Source Agreement, version 1.3, is not a free software license because it includes a provision requiring changes to be your “original creation”. Free software development depends on combining code from third parties, and the NASA license doesn't permit this.
We urge you not to use this license. In addition, if you are a United States citizen, please write to NASA and call for the use of a truly free software license.
