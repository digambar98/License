This is a permissive non-copyleft free software license with a few requirements (in sections 4 and 5) that render it incompatible with the GNU GPL. Note that the latest version of OpenLDAP has a different license that is compatible with the GNU GPL.
We urge you not to use the older OpenLDAP license for software you write. However, there is no reason to avoid running programs that have been released under this license
