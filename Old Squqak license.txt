The original Squeak license, as applied to software, is not a free software license because it requires all users in whatever country to obey US export control laws. As applied to fonts, it also does not permit modification.
In addition, it has a requirement for users to indemnify the developer, which is enough to make many users think twice about using it at all.
Recent versions of Squeak (from 4.0 on) are released under an Expat-style License with some portions of the code under the Apache License 2.0.
