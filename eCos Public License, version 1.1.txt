This was the old license of eCos. It is not a free software license, because it requires sending every published modified version to a specific initial developer. There are also some other words in this license whose meaning we're not sure of that might also be problematic.
Today eCos is available under the GNU GPL with additional permission for linking with nonfree programs.
