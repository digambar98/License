This is not a free software license. The license prohibits distribution for a fee, and that makes it impossible for the software to be included in the many CD-ROM free software collections that are sold by companies and by organizations.
There may be another problem in section 2a, but a word seems to be missing there, so it is hard to be sure what meaning is really intended.
(The YaST software itself no longer uses this nonfree YaST license; happily, it is now free software, released under the GNU GPL.)
