This license is also sometimes called the “4-clause BSD license”.
This is a lax, permissive non-copyleft free software license with a serious flaw: the “obnoxious BSD advertising clause”. The flaw is not fatal; that is, it does not render the software nonfree. But it does cause practical problems, including incompatibility with the GNU GPL.
We urge you not to use the original BSD license for software you write. If you want to use a lax, permissive non-copyleft free software license, it is much better to use the modified BSD license, the X11 license or the Expat license. Even better, for a substantial program, use the Apache 2.0 license since it takes action against patent treachery.
However, there is no reason not to use programs that have been released under the original BSD license.
